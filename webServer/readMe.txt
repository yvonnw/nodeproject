This server is created for the project used to manage story and task under agile mode. 

It is base on mysql database and is supposed to be operated via webpage, such as, add story and task, review them.

Currently mysql and express are newly installed and some basic confgure is done on express, js file can be triggered to add data into database, but cannot add via web page, it always tell 'cannot post' or 'cannot get', I am working on it.
